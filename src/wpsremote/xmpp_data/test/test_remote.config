# . Plain standard FTP Protocol (based on ftplib)
#       ftpUpload.FtpUpload
# . FTP over TLS (FTPS) Protocol (based on ftplib)

# . "encryptor" you can use encrypted passwords with a private/public key couple
#
# . To generate a new private key use the following command:
#     openssl genrsa -out myTestKey.pem -passout pass:"f00bar" -des3 2048
#
# . To generate a new public key use the following command:
#     openssl rsa -pubout -in myTestKey.pem -passin pass:"f00bar" -out myTestKey.pub
#
# . To encrypt your password use the following utility
#     python encrypt.py password path/to/rsakey.pub passphrase
#
# . To double check the password is correct use the following utility
#     python decrypt.py password path/to/rsakey.pem passphrase
